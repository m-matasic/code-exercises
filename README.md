# App Examples

Here you can see my app examples. I will try to add more from time to time.

#### Description

Each of apps is built with the same functionality, but in different versions of the same programming language or libraries.  
For example, I made Score Counter app in JavaScript and then in jQuery. Both have the same functionality.  
Quiz app is built with JavaScript in version ES5, then in ES6, and then in jQuery. They also have the same functionality.

## List of Apps till now:

### Quiz

* built with JavaScript in ES5 (prototypes)
* built with JavaScript in ES6 (classes)
